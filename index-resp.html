      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/profile pic.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>To give a little background, I'm 28 years old and recently engaged to my beautiful fiance Cassidi. We
        have just
        recently relocated out here to Arizona from California and our family consists of just one dog whos
        name
        is
        Roman and he is a husky. My educational background consists of a B.A. in business administration
        with an
        emphasis in management. Some of the hobbies/passions that I enjoy in the my free time would be
        golfing,
        playing
        and watching hockey, and playing video games.</p>
      <P>What began my interest in learning how to code started when I first began working for Coca-Cola in
        southern
        California. Working there as account manager I was always more facinated with the behind the scenes
        kind
        of work
        and the data and information we used out in field. At that point I knew I wanted to make my life
        long
        career to
        be in the IT industry, specifically in the coding and infrastructure aspect of it.</P>
